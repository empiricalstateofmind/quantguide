# Brexit Hedging


When Brexit happened, the pound lost value compared to the US dollar.
What happened to the FTSE 100 over the same period?
Why is this the case (multiple reasons)?
Suppose we are one month before Brexit and we hold a long/short portfolio of FTSE 100 stocks.
How can we effectively hedge against Brexit movements?
