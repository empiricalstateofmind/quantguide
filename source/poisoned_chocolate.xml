<question>
Suppose we have a chocolate bar which can be thought of as a 10x10 grid of pieces.
This chocolate bar has one piece which is laden with cyanide, and we know this piece is in the bottom left corner.

We play a two-person game where a player breaks the chocolate along an axis (at any point), and hands the remaining part with the poison to the other player, who does the same. 
The game finishes when a player is left with the single poisoned piece, and they obviously lose!

You are given the chance to go first or second.
Which do you prefer?
Given your choice, what is the best strategy to follow?

As a follow up question, how may you program a computer to come up with the best strategy?
