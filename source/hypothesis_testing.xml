<question>
We are investigating whether a drug has an effect of increasing the IQ of participants.
Their changes in IQ after taking the drug are
\begin{align*}
    0.7, −1.6, −0.2, −1.2, −0.1, 3.4, 3.7, 0.8, 0.0, 2.0.
\end{align*}
Does this data support the conclusion that the drug is effective? 
</question>
<answer>
We want to test the hypothesis that the drug has no effect.
In this case our hypothesis is $\mu_0=0$, the mean of the differences is unchanged.
Our alternative hypothesis is $\mu_0 > 0$.
This is a *one-sided* test, since we do not test whether the drug potentially reduces the IQ of the participants.

We can calculate the $t$-statistic as 
\begin{align*}
    t_{\rm obs} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} = 3.68,
\end{align*}
since $\bar{x}=2.33, \mu_0=0, s^2=4.0, n=10$.

If $H_0$ is true, then the probability of observing this value of $t(\vec{X})$ is
\begin{align*}
    p &= \Pr( t(\vec{X}) \ge 3.68) \\
     &= \Pr(t_9 \ge 3.68) \\
     &= 0.0025.
\end{align*} 
This means that, if $H_0$ is true, then we would see this result about $0.25\%$ of the time, that is, an extremely rare event.
Under these conditions we would reject the null hypothesis.
