# The Mystery Box

A mystery box has an unspecified amount of money in it, however we know that it is distributed uniformly between \pounds$0$ and \pounds$1,000,000$.
The amount in the box is known to the owner however
The owner invites you to play a game where you bid $B \in [0,1,000,000]$ for the box. 
If $B \ge \frac{2}{3}T$ where $T$ is the amount in the box, you win the box, otherwise the bid is not accepted and nothing happens. 
What is the optimum amount to bid for the box?
