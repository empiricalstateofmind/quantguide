<question>
A mystery box has an unspecified amount of money in it, however we know that it is distributed uniformly between £0 and £1,000,000.
The amount in the box is known to the owner however.
The owner invites you to play a game where you bid $B \in [0,1,000,000]$ for the box. 
If $B \ge \frac{2}{3}T$ where $T$ is the amount in the box, you win the box, otherwise the bid is not accepted and nothing happens. 
What is the optimum amount to bid for the box?
</question>
<answer>
To make this question easier, it is useful to rescale everything to between zero and one, so that we know $T \sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$.
We want to work out the expected return from a guess $B$.
From the problem we have two things that happen, our bid is rejected and we win nothing, or our bid is accepted.
 
Without any prior information on the box we can easily calculate the expectation $E(T)=0.5$.
If our bid is accepted, we now know something else about the box, namely that $T<\frac{3}{2}B$.
In this case we now now that $(T|\text{Accepted}) \sim \text{Unif}(0,\frac{3}{2}B)$, which has expectation $\frac{3}{4}B$.
In this case our expected payoff is $P = \frac{3}{4}B - B = -\frac{1}{4}B$.
Clearly this is negative for any choice of $B$, and so our optimal choice is $B=0$.
Since we have a choice between a negative payoff and zero, we do not need to factor in the probabilities of acceptance.

Note, this question is sometimes equally phrased as "acceptance if $B$ is greater than $T$, however the payoff is $1.5T$."
You can repeat the exercise above to see they are equivalent.
