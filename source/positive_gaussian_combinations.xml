<question>
Suppose we have two normal random varaibles, $X,Y \sim N(0,1)$, which are uncorrelated.

What is $P(X - 3Y > 0)$?

Furthermore what is $P(X - 3Y > 0| Y > 0 )$?
</question>
<answer>
The first part is simple if you know how to add and subtract two distributions.
We can treat $X-3Y$ as a new random variable $Z$.
$Z$ has distribution $N(0,10)$, since $E[X-3Y] = E[X] - 3E[Y]$, and $Var[X-3Y] = Var[X] + 9Var[Y]$.
We then know that $P(X-3Y>0)=P(Z>0)=\Phi(0)=\frac{1}{2}$.

The second part is more nuanced, and is best reasoned graphically.
If we plot the $(X,Y)$-plane, then all the probability we calculated in the first part is below the like $y=\frac{1}{3}x$.
Now we have the further restriction $y>0$, so we can see that the answer is given by the infinite wedge between these two lines.
Using the angle we can see that we have $P(X - 3Y > 0| Y > 0 ) = \arctan(1/3)/\pi$.
